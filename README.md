  <strong>Pokedex from Pokémon Game Boy versions</strong><br>
  With <a href="https://facebook.github.io/react-native/">React Native</a>
</p>

## 📱 Overview

Retrodex is a simple offline retro pokedex. The goal of this project is to re-create the Pokedex from Pokémon Red, Blue and Yellow versions released in the 90's. Sprites, sounds and user experience aim to match original games.

## 🤓 Motivations

Fun! And also because I grew up with this addictive game, like most of the people of my generation. Moreover, I wanted to make a first step into React Native with a simple and nostalgic app to pay a tribute to this incredible game!
