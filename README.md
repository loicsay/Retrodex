  <strong>Pokedex from Pok√©mon Game Boy red/blue version</strong><br>
  With <a href="https://facebook.github.io/react-native/">React Native</a>
</p>

## ü§ì Motivations

Fun! And also because I grew up with this addictive game, like most of the people of my generation. Moreover, I wanted to make a first step into React Native with a simple and nostalgic app to pay a tribute to this incredible game!

## üôè Thanks to...

- Jalyna for [oakdex](https://github.com/jalyna/oakdex-pokedex), that serves me as a base for the Pok√©dex
